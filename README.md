# Setting up a new workstation

The reason behind this repo is to keep track for the future, of all customizations + tools i need.  
It' ll be particularly useful when setting up a new PC or wroking station.

It'll have both MacOS tutorial and a Linux one. In my current job, i have a MacOS laptop but most of the work is done on a Red Hat CentOs.  

To find out which distro you are using

```bash
cat /proc/version
```

Of course using  UNIX systems is pretty much the same, but some differencies between MaxOS and Linux exists, e.g. Brew vs Apt as package manager or ENV variables.  
So i'll be useful to keep track of both of them.
